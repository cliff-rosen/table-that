## Changes from current ROADMAP.md

| Change | Item | From | To | Reasoning |
|--------|------|------|----|-----------|
| Priority | #3 | P1 | P1 | Keep — directly affects core loop UX |
| Priority | #4 | P1 | P1 | Keep — directly affects core loop UX |
| Priority | #14 | P1 | P3 | Meta-feature, doesn't help users reach value |
| Priority | #15 | P1 | P2 | Generic strategies cover Tier 1 verticals now |
| Priority | #16 | P1 | P2 | Progressive enhancement, not launch-blocking |
| Priority | #17 | P1 | P2 | Progressive enhancement, coercion handles type fitting |
| Priority | #19 | P1 | P2 | Population works without SerpAPI |
| Priority | #20 | P1 | P2 | Matters after usage proves the core loop |
| Priority | #22 | P1 | P2 | Real issue but not user-facing enough for launch |
| Priority | #6 | P2 | P3 | Desktop-first workflow; mobile viewing matters only after sharing exists |
| Priority | #7 | P2 | P3 | Speculative, no user signal |
| Priority | #10 | P1 | — | Already done — Playwright MCP is configured and working |
| Status | #10 | open | done | Playwright MCP is installed and used for demos/QA |
| New | #25 | — | P1/CORE | First-time user onboarding (suggested prompts, templates) |
| New | #26 | — | P2/GROWTH | Distribution plan (publish demos, content marketing, outreach) |
| New | #27 | — | P2/CORE | Enrichment error UX (clear feedback when research fails) |

## Details

### #25 — First-time user onboarding (suggested prompts, templates)
When a new user signs up, they land on an empty tables list page with a chat panel. There's no guidance on what to do. The time-to-first-value target (<5 minutes) depends entirely on the user figuring out what to type. Add: (1) suggested first prompts on the empty state ("Try: 'Build me a list of Italian restaurants in Chicago'" or similar, tailored to common use cases), (2) optional template gallery (pre-built schemas for common verticals: vendor comparison, publisher tracking, apartment hunting), (3) a brief "how it works" tooltip or banner on first visit. The goal is to get the user to their first populated table as fast as possible.

### #26 — Distribution plan (publish demos, content marketing, outreach)
Demo videos exist (_demo/) but aren't published anywhere. No social media presence, no blog, no Product Hunt listing, no content marketing. Create a distribution task list: (1) publish demo videos to YouTube/Twitter/LinkedIn, (2) write 2-3 use-case blog posts, (3) plan a Product Hunt launch, (4) identify 5-10 communities (Reddit, forums, Slack groups) where target users hang out and share relevant demos. This is a task, not a feature — it requires time and judgment, not code.

### #27 — Enrichment error UX (clear feedback when research fails)
When for_each_row research fails for a row (timeout, 403, no results), the user needs clear feedback: what happened, which rows failed, and what they can do about it (retry, skip, try a different question). The research log captures failure details, but the DataProposalCard UX for failed/partial results may not surface this clearly. Check the current error experience and improve it.
