ARTICLE CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES

When analyzing articles in this genetics stream, classify each article's strategic position in litigation:

## PRO-DEFENSE: PREDISPOSITION
Classify as pro-defense when the article:
- Demonstrates mesothelioma/ovarian cancer can occur due to genetics with minimal or no asbestos/talc exposure
- Documents germline mutations causing disease independently
- Shows familial clustering without occupational exposure
- Quantifies penetrance of genetic mutations
- Provides an alternative causation pathway

Key test: Does this show genetics can cause disease WITHOUT exposure?

## PRO-PLAINTIFF: SUSCEPTIBILITY
Classify as pro-plaintiff when the article:
- Demonstrates genetic variants ENHANCE risk FROM asbestos/talc exposure
- Shows gene-environment interaction requiring BOTH genetics AND exposure
- Documents differential susceptibility based on genotype
- Quantifies modified dose-response in genetically susceptible individuals

Key test: Does this show genetics increase risk ONLY when exposed?

## NEUTRAL
Classify as neutral when the article:
- Focuses on molecular characterization without causation implications
- Focuses on treatment or prognosis
- Describes methodological advances
- Requires further analysis to determine strategic position

## MIXED
Classify as mixed when the article:
- Shows both predisposition and susceptibility mechanisms
- Contains data that could support either interpretation
- Has insufficient exposure documentation to distinguish

## EXPOSURE VERIFICATION

For genetic predisposition claims, verify:
- Was exposure history systematically assessed?
- Were "minimal exposure" claims documented with industrial hygiene data?
- Or is "no exposure" assumed without verification?

For genetic susceptibility claims, verify:
- Was exposure quantified?
- Was gene-environment interaction statistically tested?
- Or is interaction merely implied?
