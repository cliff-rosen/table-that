      Research streams are configured pipelines that automatically find and curate relevant research.

      **How Streams Work:**
      1. **Search** - Queries run against PubMed and other sources
      2. **Filter** - Results are filtered by relevance criteria
      3. **Enrich** - AI generates summaries and analysis
      4. **Categorize** - Articles are organized into themes
      5. **Report** - A report is generated on schedule

      **Stream Scope:**
      Streams have different visibility levels:
      - **Personal** - Only visible to the creator
      - **Organization** - Shared with your organization
      - **Global** - Platform-wide, managed by platform admins

      **Viewing Streams:**
      Go to the Streams page to see all streams you have access to.
      Click a stream to see its details, recent reports, and configuration.

      Create streams to monitor specific research areas.

      **To Create a Stream:**
      1. Go to the Streams page
      2. Click "Create Stream"
      3. Enter stream name and purpose
      4. Choose scope (personal, organization, or global)
      5. Configure the four layers (see below)

      **Four-Layer Architecture:**

      1. **Semantic Space** - Define your research focus
         - Key concepts and entities
         - Relationships between concepts
         - Domain terminology

      2. **Retrieval Config** - How to find articles
         - PubMed search queries
         - Date range settings
         - Semantic filters for relevance
         - Broad queries for discovery

      3. **Presentation Config** - How to organize results
         - Define article categories
         - Set category descriptions
         - Configure sorting and grouping

      4. **Enrichment Config** - AI enhancement
         - Executive summary prompts
         - Category-level analysis
         - Article enrichment settings

      **Schedule:**
      Set how often reports generate (daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly).

      Edit streams to refine search criteria and improve results.

      **Who Can Edit:**
      - Personal streams: Only the creator
      - Organization streams: Org admins and platform admins
      - Global streams: Platform admins only

      **Editing Process:**
      1. Go to Streams page
      2. Click the stream you want to edit
      3. Click "Edit" or the edit icon
      4. Use the tabbed interface to modify each layer:
         - Semantic Space
         - Retrieval Config
         - Presentation Config
         - Enrichment Config

      **Testing Changes:**
      - Use "Test Query" to preview search results
      - Run a manual pipeline to see full results
      - Review generated reports before publishing

      **Chat Assistance:**
      The chat assistant can help with:
      - Query refinement suggestions
      - Concept extraction from documents
      - Category organization recommendations

    summary: How to manually run a stream pipeline

      Pipelines can run automatically on schedule or manually on demand.

      **Manual Run:**
      1. Go to the stream detail page
      2. Click "Run Pipeline" button
      3. The pipeline will:
         - Execute search queries
         - Apply filters
         - Generate AI enrichments
         - Create a draft report

      **Pipeline Stages:**
      - **Retrieval** - Fetching articles from sources
      - **Filtering** - Applying relevance criteria
      - **Enrichment** - AI summary generation
      - **Report Creation** - Assembling final report

      **Monitoring:**
      - View pipeline status on the stream page
      - Platform admins can see all pipelines in Operations
      - Failed pipelines show error details

      **After Running:**
      - New report appears in the Reports page
      - May require approval before publishing (depending on settings)
