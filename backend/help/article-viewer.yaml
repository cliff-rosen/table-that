      Notes let you capture thoughts and observations about specific articles.

      **Adding Notes:**
      1. Open the article in the Article Viewer
      2. Click the **Notes** tab
      3. Click the **Add Note** button
      4. Type your note in the text area
      5. Choose **Personal** or **Shared** visibility
      6. Click **Save Note** to store the note

      **Personal vs Shared:**
      - **Personal notes** are private — only you can see them. Use these for your own working thoughts, draft observations, or reminders.
      - **Shared notes** are visible to all members of your organization. Use these to flag findings for colleagues, record team decisions, or share analysis.
      - New notes default to Personal.
      - You can change a note's visibility at any time by editing it.

      **Editing and Deleting:**
      - Only the author of a note can edit or delete it.
      - Click the pencil icon on your note to edit its content or change its visibility.
      - Click the trash icon to delete a note (you'll be asked to confirm).

      **Tips:**
      - Use personal notes for preliminary thoughts you're not ready to share
      - Use shared notes to flag important findings for your team
      - Notes persist across sessions and are saved per article
