      ## Chat Assistant Overview

      The chat panel is available on the **Tables List**, **Table View**, and **Schema Editor** pages. It's the primary power interface — every significant operation flows through chat as a reviewable proposal.

      ### What the Chat Helps With at Each Phase

      1. **Define** (Tables List & Schema Editor) — Describe what you want to track and the assistant proposes a complete table schema. Refine columns, types, and options through conversation.
         - "I need a bug tracker with title, severity, status, and assignee"
         - "Add a Priority column with options P0, P1, P2, P3"

      2. **Populate** (Table View) — Get data into your table. The assistant can generate sample data, help you add records one by one, or research entries from the web.
         - "Add 10 sample bugs"
         - "Add a bug: Login timeout, Critical, Open"

      3. **Enhance** (Table View) — Enrich your data. Ask the assistant to add new columns and then research values across your rows.
         - "Add a Website column and look up the URL for each company"
         - "Find the LinkedIn page for each person in the table"

      ### Three Interaction Modes

      1. **How-to questions** — Ask how to do something and the assistant retrieves help documentation.
         - "How do I filter by status?"
         - "What column types are available?"

      2. **Single-row data operations** — Quick adds, edits, and deletes using direct tools.
         - "Add a bug: Login timeout, Critical, Open"
         - "Delete row 12"
         - "Change row 5's status to Closed"

      3. **Proposals** — Schema changes and multi-row data operations appear inline in the table for review.
         - "Add a Priority column with options P0, P1, P2, P3" → columns highlighted in the table
         - "Add 10 sample bugs" → rows highlighted in the table
         - "Mark all Open bugs as Closed" → changed cells highlighted in the table

      ### What the Assistant Knows

      On the **Table View** page, the assistant automatically sees:
      - Your table name, description, and full column schema
      - The first 20 rows of data as a sample
      - Total row count
      - Active filters and sort state

      On the **Schema Editor** page, the assistant sees:
      - Your table name, description, and full column schema (with column IDs)
      - Row count (to warn about data impact of schema changes)

      The assistant can also use tools to see more data — it can paginate through all rows, search, and get statistical summaries.

      ## Schema Proposals

      A **Schema Proposal** is how the chat assistant proposes changes to your table structure. Any request to add, remove, modify, or reorder columns is previewed inline in the table.

      ### How to Ask for Schema Changes

      Describe what you want in natural language:
      - "Add a Priority column with options High, Medium, Low"
      - "Make the Email column required"
      - "Remove the Notes column"
      - "Add 'Deferred' to the Status options"
      - "Rename Severity to Priority"
      - "I need a bug tracker with title, severity, status, and assignee"
      - "Reorder columns so Status comes after Title"

      ### How Proposals Appear

      Proposed changes are shown directly in the table:
      - **Add** (green): New columns appear in-place with a green highlight
      - **Modify** (amber): Changed columns are highlighted with an amber border
      - **Remove** (red): Columns to be removed are shown with a red highlight and reduced opacity

      An action strip appears above the table summarizing the changes with **Apply** and **Dismiss** buttons.

      ### Reviewing and Applying

      1. Review the proposed changes highlighted in the table
      2. Click **Apply** to execute the changes, or **Dismiss** to cancel
      3. The table schema updates immediately on Apply

      ### Important Notes
      - Removing a column deletes all data in that column permanently
      - Changing a column type may affect how existing data is displayed
      - The assistant uses column IDs internally for reliable targeting — renaming a column won't confuse it
      - You can request multiple changes at once and they'll appear as a single proposal
      - For select columns with 3-8 options (like Status or Priority), the assistant may set `filterDisplay: "tab"` so the filter bar shows inline buttons instead of a dropdown

      ## Data Proposals

      A **Data Proposal** is how the chat assistant proposes bulk data changes. Any request involving multiple rows — adding, updating, or deleting — is previewed inline in the table.

      ### When Data Proposals Are Used

      The assistant uses a Data Proposal whenever:
      - You ask to add multiple rows: "Add 10 sample bugs"
      - You ask to update multiple rows: "Mark all Open bugs as Closed"
      - You ask to delete multiple rows: "Delete all rows where Status is Withdrawn"
      - You ask for data transformations: "Capitalize all company names"
      - You ask to populate the table: "Generate some test data"

      For a single explicit row (e.g., "Add a bug called Login timeout"), the assistant uses a direct tool instead — no proposal needed.

      ### How Proposals Appear

      Proposed changes are shown directly in the table:
      - **Additions** (green): New rows appear at the top with a green highlight and left border
      - **Updates** (amber): Existing rows show changed cells highlighted in amber
      - **Deletions** (red): Rows to be deleted are shown with a red highlight and reduced opacity

      An action bar appears above the table with a summary (e.g., "3 additions, 2 updates, 1 deletion"), checkboxes to toggle individual operations, and **Apply** / **Dismiss** buttons.

      ### Reviewing and Applying

      1. Review the proposed changes highlighted inline in the table
      2. Uncheck any operations you don't want in the action bar
      3. Click **Apply** to execute the checked operations
      4. Watch the progress as changes are applied one by one
      5. When complete, click **Done** — the data table refreshes

      ### How Apply Works

      Unlike schema proposals (which apply atomically), data proposals execute each operation individually:
      - Each add creates a row via the API
      - Each update modifies a row via the API
      - Each delete removes a row via the API

      This means some operations can succeed even if others fail. The action bar shows progress for each operation.

      ### Tips
      - For bulk updates, the assistant reads your data first to find matching rows by row ID
      - You can ask for changes based on conditions: "Set all Critical bugs' assignee to Sarah"
      - The assistant checks for duplicates before proposing additions
      - If the table has many rows, the assistant paginates through the data to find all matches

      ## Single-Row Operations via Chat

      For simple, single-row changes, the chat assistant acts immediately using tools — no proposal to review.

      ### Adding a Single Row
      - "Add a bug: Login page crashes on Safari, Critical, Open"
      - "Add a record for Acme Corp, position: Engineer, status: Applied"
      - "Create a new row with name John Doe, age 30"

      The assistant maps your values to the right columns and creates the row directly.

      ### Updating a Single Row
      - "Change row 5's status to Closed"
      - "Set the priority of row 12 to High"
      - "Update row 3: assignee = Sarah, status = In Progress"

      You need to reference the row by its ID (shown in the # column on the left of the table).

      ### Deleting a Single Row
      - "Delete row 12"
      - "Remove row 7"

      Deletion is immediate — there's no undo.

      ### When Direct Tools vs Proposals

      | Request | Method |
      |---------|--------|
      | "Add a bug called Login timeout" | Direct tool (single add) |
      | "Add 5 sample bugs" | Data Proposal (multiple adds) |
      | "Delete row 12" | Direct tool (single delete) |
      | "Delete all Closed bugs" | Data Proposal (multiple deletes) |
      | "Update row 3's status" | Direct tool (single update) |
      | "Mark all Open bugs as Closed" | Data Proposal (multiple updates) |

      The rule: **one row, explicit** → direct tool. **Multiple rows or conditional** → proposal.

      ### Searching Data
      You can also ask the assistant to find data:
      - "Search for Safari"
      - "Find all rows mentioning login"
      - "What rows have Sarah as assignee?"

      The assistant searches across text columns and returns matching rows.

      ### Describing the Table
      - "Describe this table"
      - "How many rows are there?"
      - "What are the value distributions for Status?"

      The assistant can summarize schema, row counts, and value distributions for select/boolean columns.

      ## Web Search & Research

      The chat assistant has access to web tools that let it look up information online.

      ### Web Search
      Ask the assistant to search for something:
      - "Search for Acme Corp website"
      - "Look up the latest funding round for Company X"
      - "Find the Wikipedia page for CRISPR"

      The assistant uses DuckDuckGo to search and returns titles, URLs, and snippets.

      ### Fetching Webpages
      Ask the assistant to read a specific URL:
      - "Fetch https://example.com and tell me what it's about"
      - "Read the homepage of acme.com"

      The assistant fetches the page, extracts its text content, and can answer questions about it.

      ### Research Agent
      For factual questions, the assistant can use **research_web** — a mini search agent that autonomously searches the web and reads pages to find a definitive answer:
      - "What is DuckDuckGo's LinkedIn URL?"
      - "When was Company X founded?"
      - "What is the headquarters address of Acme Corp?"

      The research agent loops through multiple search/fetch rounds to arrive at a concise answer.

      ### Use Cases
      - Populating table data: "Add the website URL for this company" — the assistant searches, finds it, and adds it
      - Verifying data: "Is this company still active? Check their website"
      - Research: "What does this company do?" — the assistant searches and summarizes

      ## Enriching Data with Web Research

      The chat assistant can automatically research each row in your table and fill in missing information using the **enrich_column** tool.

      ### How It Works

      When you ask to fill in a column based on web research:
      1. The assistant identifies the target column and rows to enrich
      2. It calls **enrich_column** with the appropriate strategy (lookup, research, or computation)
      3. For each row, the enrichment agent searches the web and reads pages to find the value
      4. You can watch the progress as each row is processed (search queries, page fetches)
      5. All results appear inline in the table — updated cells are highlighted in amber
      6. An action bar lets you expand the research log, uncheck any results, and click **Apply** or **Dismiss**

      ### Enrichment Strategies

      - **Lookup**: Simple factual lookups with definitive answers — "Find the founding year for each company"
      - **Research**: Multi-source web research that synthesizes findings — "Summarize recent news about each company"
      - **Computation**: Derive values from existing columns — "Calculate Price × Quantity"

      ### Examples

      - "For each company, find their LinkedIn URL"
      - "Look up the website for each company"
      - "Find the headquarters city for each organization"
      - "Research the founding year for each company"
      - "Add a column for Company Size and research it for each row"

      ### How to Use

      1. Make sure your table has the target column (or ask the assistant to add one first)
      2. Ask the assistant: "Look up the LinkedIn URL for each company"
      3. Watch the research progress as each row is processed
      4. Review the proposed changes highlighted inline in the table
      5. Uncheck any incorrect results in the action bar, then click **Apply**

      ### Bulk Transformations (No Web Required)

      For simple multi-row changes that don't need web research, use a **Data Proposal**:
      - "Change all Open bugs to In Progress"
      - "Set the priority to High for all bugs assigned to Sarah"
      - "Capitalize all company names"

      ### Key Points

      - Results appear inline in the table — nothing changes until you click **Apply**
      - You can uncheck individual row updates you don't want before applying
      - Multiple enrichment calls (e.g., filling two columns) are automatically merged into one proposal
      - The enrichment tool processes up to 200 rows per call
