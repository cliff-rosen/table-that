      ## What is table.that?

      table.that is a modern data table builder. You define table schemas with typed columns, manage records through a clean spreadsheet-like interface, and use the AI chat assistant to help you build, populate, and analyze your data.

      - **Schema Editor** (`/tables/:id/edit`): Modify your table's column definitions, reorder columns, and change types.
