      Knowledge Horizon is built around three core entities in a clear hierarchy.

      ## Stream (Research Stream)

      A **stream** is an automated research monitor focused on a specific topic area.
      Think of it as a "saved search" that runs regularly and compiles results into reports.

      **What defines a stream:**
      - A focus area (e.g., "CAR-T Cell Therapy Safety" or "GLP-1 Agonists in Diabetes")
      - Search queries that find relevant articles in PubMed
      - A schedule (daily, weekly, etc.) for checking new publications

      **Key relationship:** One stream produces many reports over time.

      ## Report

      A **report** is a snapshot of recent research from a stream, covering a specific date range.

      **What a report contains:**
      - **Executive summary** - AI-generated overview of key findings
      - **Categories** - Articles grouped by theme
      - **Articles** - The individual papers, each with its own summary

      **Key relationships:**
      - A report belongs to one stream
      - A report contains many articles
      - Reports are generated automatically on schedule or manually on-demand

      ## Article

      An **article** is a single research publication (paper, review, etc.) from PubMed.

      **What you see for each article:**
      - **PMID** - PubMed's unique identifier (links to original)
      - **Title, authors, journal** - Basic bibliographic info
      - **Abstract** - The authors' original summary
      - **AI summary** - Knowledge Horizon's summary focused on why this article matters to the stream
      - **Categories** - Which thematic groups this article belongs to

      **Key relationship:** An article can appear in multiple reports (if it remains relevant over time or appears in different streams).

      Features you'll encounter when viewing individual articles.

      ## Filter Score

      A relevance rating from 0.0 to 1.0 showing how well an article matches the stream's focus.

      - **0.9 - 1.0** - Highly relevant, directly on-topic
      - **0.7 - 0.9** - Clearly relevant
      - **0.5 - 0.7** - Somewhat relevant, may be tangential
      - **Below 0.5** - Usually filtered out automatically

      The score helps you prioritize reading. Articles with higher scores are more likely to contain findings directly relevant to your research interest.

      ## AI Summary vs Abstract

      - **Abstract** - Written by the paper's authors. Summarizes what the paper is about.
      - **AI Summary** - Generated by Knowledge Horizon. Explains why this paper matters *to your stream's focus*.

      The AI summary highlights findings relevant to your specific topic, even if they're buried in a broader paper.

      ## Favorites (Starring)

      Mark articles as favorites for quick access later.

      **How to star an article:**
      - Click the star icon on any article card in a report
      - Or click the star button in the Article Viewer header

      **Viewing your favorites:**
      - In the report sidebar, click "Favorites" to see all starred articles for that stream
      - Favorites show the article with its full context (AI summary, stance analysis, etc.)
      - Click any favorite to open it in the Article Viewer

      **Key behaviors:**
      - Stars are personal - only you see your starred articles
      - Stars persist across sessions
      - Each favorite remembers which report it came from

      ## Notes

      Add your own comments or observations to articles.

      - Notes are saved per article and persist across sessions
      - Notes are visible to other users in your organization

      ## Category Assignment

      Each article is assigned to one or more thematic categories within the report.

      Categories are determined automatically based on the article's content and the stream's configuration. They help you quickly scan for articles on specific subtopics.

      Features you'll encounter when viewing reports.

      ## Executive Summary

      An AI-generated overview of the entire report (typically 2-4 paragraphs).

      **What it covers:**
      - Major themes across all articles
      - Notable findings or trends
      - Key takeaways for quick understanding

      Read this first to get oriented before diving into individual articles.

      ## Categories

      Reports organize articles into thematic groups for easier navigation.

      **Each category includes:**
      - A descriptive name (e.g., "Clinical Trial Results", "Mechanism Studies")
      - A summary of what articles in this category cover
      - The list of articles belonging to it

      Click a category to see only those articles, or browse all articles together.

      ## Key Highlights

      Bullet-point summaries of the most important findings.

      **Used for:**
      - Quick scanning when you're short on time
      - Email digests
      - Sharing with colleagues

      Highlights extract the "so what" from each significant finding.

      ## Approval Status

      Reports may have one of these statuses:

      - **Awaiting Approval** - Generated but pending admin review
      - **Approved** - Reviewed and released for viewing
      - **Rejected** - Not approved (with reason provided)

      You'll typically only see approved reports unless you're an administrator.

      Different tools for exploring your research content.

      ## Article Viewer

      The default view for reading individual articles.

      **Features:**
      - Full abstract and AI summary
      - Filter score and reasoning
      - Star button to add to favorites
      - Notes for personal annotations
      - Link to original PubMed entry

      ## Tablizer

      A spreadsheet-like view for analyzing multiple articles at once.

      **What it offers:**
      - All articles in a sortable, filterable table
      - Column customization (show/hide fields)
      - **AI Columns** - Custom columns that analyze each article (e.g., "Is this a clinical trial?")
      - Export to CSV

      Tablizer is especially useful for:
      - Systematic screening of articles
      - Extracting structured data
      - Finding articles that match specific criteria

      ## Deep Research

      An AI-powered research assistant that searches and synthesizes information.

      **How it works:**
      1. Ask a research question
      2. The tool searches PubMed and web sources
      3. It synthesizes findings into an answer with citations

      Use Deep Research for exploratory questions that span multiple sources.

      ## PubMed Search

      Direct search of PubMed from within Knowledge Horizon.

      **Features:**
      - Full PubMed query syntax support
      - Results displayed with abstracts
      - Can view full text when available

      Use this for ad-hoc searches outside your configured streams.

    roles: [org_admin, platform_admin]
    order: 50
    content: |
      Concepts relevant to stream administrators and curators.

      ## Curation

      Human review and adjustment of automated decisions.

      **Curator actions:**
      - **Include** - Add an article that was filtered out
      - **Exclude** - Remove an article that passed the filter
      - **Edit summary** - Modify an article's AI summary
      - **Reassign categories** - Move articles between categories

      Curation decisions are preserved when reports are regenerated.

      ## Semantic Filter

      AI-powered relevance assessment that decides which articles make it into reports.

      **How it works:**
      1. Each stream has filter criteria defining "what's relevant"
      2. For each new article, AI reads it and assigns a score (0.0 to 1.0)
      3. Articles scoring above the threshold are included

      **Why "semantic":** Unlike keyword matching, semantic filters understand meaning. An article about "cytokine storm management" would match a filter for "CAR-T adverse events" even without those exact words.

      ## Threshold

      The minimum filter score for automatic inclusion.

      - Typical values: 0.5 to 0.7
      - Higher = stricter filtering, fewer but more relevant articles
      - Lower = broader coverage, more articles but may include tangential ones

      ## Pipeline

      The automated process that creates reports.

      **Steps:**
      1. Query PubMed for new articles
      2. Apply semantic filter
      3. Generate AI summaries
      4. Assign categories
      5. Compile into report

      Pipelines run on schedule or can be triggered manually.

      ## Schedule

      When the pipeline runs automatically.

      **Options:**
      - Daily, Weekly, Biweekly, Monthly
      - Specific day and time
      - Timezone-aware

      Scheduled runs check for new articles since the last report.
