      ## Adding Records

      ### Via the Add Record Form
      1. Click "Add Record" in the toolbar
      2. Fill in the form — each column gets an appropriate input:
         - Text: text field
         - Number: number input
         - Date: date picker
         - Boolean: checkbox
         - Select: dropdown
      3. Required fields are marked with a red asterisk
      4. Click "Add Record" to save

      ### Via Inline Editing
      Not directly — you need to use the Add Record form or chat to create new rows. But once a row exists, you can click any cell to edit it inline.

      ### Via Chat
      Ask the chat assistant:
      - "Add a bug: Login page crashes on Safari, Critical, Open"
      - "Add a record for Acme Corp, position: Engineer, status: Applied"

      For a single explicit row, the assistant adds it directly. For multiple rows, it creates a **Data Proposal** card for you to review first.

      ## Editing Records

      ### Inline Editing
      Click any cell in the data table to edit it:
      - **Text**: Opens a text input — type and press Enter to save, Escape to cancel
      - **Number**: Opens a number input
      - **Date**: Opens a date picker
      - **Boolean**: Toggles immediately on click (no Enter needed)
      - **Select**: Opens a dropdown — select an option to save

      Changes save automatically when you press Enter or click away from the cell.

      ### Via Chat
      Tell the assistant what to change:
      - "Change row 5's status to Closed"
      - "Set the priority of row 12 to High"

      For a single row change, the assistant updates it directly. For multiple rows, it uses a Data Proposal.

      ## Filtering Data

      ### Filter Bar
      The filter bar sits between the toolbar and the data table. It shows filter chips for boolean and select columns.

      #### Boolean Filter Chips
      Each boolean column gets a 3-state toggle chip:
      - **All** (gray): No filter — showing all rows
      - **Yes** (highlighted): Only rows where this column is true
      - **No** (highlighted): Only rows where this column is false
      - Click the chip to cycle through states
      - Click the X to reset to All

      #### Select Filter Chips
      Each select column gets a dropdown chip:
      - Click to open a dropdown showing all options with checkboxes
      - Check/uncheck options to filter
      - The chip shows the count or names of selected options
      - Click "All" to reset
      - Click the X to clear the filter

      ### Text Search
      The search bar in the toolbar searches across all text and select columns. Type to search — results update after a short delay.

      ### Combining Filters
      - Filters are AND-combined: a row must match ALL active filters
      - Text search works on top of active filters
      - The row count in the toolbar updates to show filtered results
      - Select all / bulk delete operates on filtered rows only

      ## Sorting Data

      Click any column header to sort:
      1. First click: Sort ascending (arrow up)
      2. Second click: Sort descending (arrow down)
      3. Third click: Clear sort (no arrow)

      The active sort column shows a blue arrow icon. Only one column can be sorted at a time.

      Sort order by type:
      - **Text**: Alphabetical (A-Z / Z-A)
      - **Number**: Numeric (low-high / high-low)
      - **Date**: Chronological (oldest-newest / newest-oldest)
      - **Boolean**: False first / True first
      - **Select**: Alphabetical by option text

      ## Bulk Operations

      ### Row Selection
      - Click the checkbox on any row to select it
      - Click the header checkbox to select/deselect all visible rows
      - Selection count appears in the toolbar

      ### Bulk Delete
      1. Select the rows you want to delete
      2. Click "Delete N selected" in the toolbar
      3. Confirm the deletion

      ### Bulk Updates via Chat
      For bulk changes beyond deletion, use the chat assistant:
      - "Mark all Open bugs as Closed"
      - "Set the assignee to Sarah for all High priority items"
      - "Delete all rows where Status is Withdrawn"
      - "Add 10 sample records"

      The assistant creates a **Data Proposal** card showing every proposed change. You can:
      - Review each operation (add, update, delete)
      - Uncheck individual operations you don't want
      - Click Apply to execute the checked operations
      - Watch the progress bar as changes are applied one by one
