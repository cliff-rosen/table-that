      Reports are curated collections of recent research findings from your subscribed streams.

      **Report Structure:**
      - **Title & Date Range** - The report period and generation date
      - **Executive Summary** - AI-generated overview of key themes and findings
      - **Category Summaries** - AI summaries for each article category
      - **Articles** - Individual research articles with summaries

      **Article Information:**
      Each article includes:
      - Title and authors
      - Publication details (journal, date)
      - Abstract from the original paper
      - AI-generated summary of key findings
      - Link to full article on PubMed

      Reports are generated automatically based on the stream's schedule (daily, weekly, etc.).

    title: How Reports Are Generated
    summary: Pipeline logic, de-duplication (each PMID appears in ONE report only), date filtering

      Reports are generated through an automated pipeline that finds, filters, and organizes new articles.

      ## The Report Pipeline

      ```
      1. Query PubMed     → Find articles matching stream criteria
      2. Date Filter      → Keep only articles in the report's date range
      3. Semantic Filter  → Score relevance, keep articles above threshold
      4. De-duplicate     → Remove articles already in prior reports
      5. Summarize        → Generate AI summaries and categorize
      6. Compile Report   → Create the final report
      ```

      ## Key Behavior: Incremental Reports

      **Each article (PMID) appears in exactly ONE report per stream.**

      The system de-duplicates against all prior reports in the stream. This means:
      - Reports are always incremental - they show only NEW articles
      - An article won't repeat even if it still matches the date range
      - To find an older article, look in earlier reports

      ## Date Range Behavior

      The report's date range (start_date to end_date) filters by publication date:
      - Both dates are **inclusive**
      - Uses electronic publication date when available (before print date)
      - Articles published within this window are candidates for the report

      ## Semantic Filtering

      Not every article in the date range makes it into the report:
      - Each article is scored for relevance (0.0 to 1.0)
      - Articles below the threshold are excluded
      - Curators can override: manually include low-scoring or exclude high-scoring articles

      ## Why This Matters

      When users ask questions like:
      - "Is this PMID in multiple reports?" → **No**, each PMID appears once
      - "Why don't I see article X in this report?" → It may be in an earlier report, or filtered out
      - "How do I find all articles on topic Y?" → Search across reports, or use compare_reports
