      ## Creating Tables

      ### Via the UI
      1. Go to the Tables List page
      2. Click "New Table"
      3. Fill in:
         - **Name** (required): e.g., "Bug Tracker", "Customer List"
         - **Description** (optional): What this table is for
         - **Columns**: Add columns with name, type, required flag, and options (for select)
      4. Click "Create Table"

      ### Via Chat
      Open any table and describe what you want to build in the chat panel:
      - "I need a bug tracker with title, severity, status, and assignee"
      - "Create a table for tracking job applications"

      The assistant will propose a complete schema as a **Schema Proposal** card. You can review each column, uncheck ones you don't want, and click Apply.

      ### Via CSV Import
      1. Click "Import CSV" on the Tables List page
      2. Upload a CSV file
      3. table.that auto-detects column types
      4. Review the detected schema and adjust if needed
      5. Click Import — a new table is created with the data

      ## Editing Table Schema

      ### Via the Schema Editor
      1. From the data view, click "Edit Schema" in the header
      2. Or from the tables list, click the pencil icon on a table card
      3. In the editor:
         - Edit column names, types, and required status
         - For select columns, edit the options list (one per line)
         - Reorder columns with the up/down arrows
         - Remove columns with the trash icon
         - Add new columns with "Add Column"
      4. Click "Save Changes"

      ### Via Chat
      On either the data view or schema editor page, tell the chat assistant what you want:
      - "Add a Priority column with options High, Medium, Low"
      - "Make the Email column required"
      - "Remove the Notes column"
      - "Add 'Deferred' to the Status options"
      - "Rename Severity to Priority"

      The assistant responds with a **Schema Proposal** card showing each change. Review, uncheck any you don't want, and click Apply.

      ### Important Notes
      - Removing a column deletes all data in that column — the assistant warns you
      - Changing a column type may affect existing data
      - Column IDs are stable — renaming a column doesn't break existing data

      ## Importing Data

      ### Import into Existing Table
      1. Open the table you want to import into
      2. Click "Import" in the toolbar
      3. Upload a CSV file
      4. The system maps CSV columns to table columns by name
      5. Review the mapping and click Import

      ### Create New Table from CSV
      1. From the Tables List, click "Import CSV"
      2. Upload your file
      3. table.that auto-detects:
         - Column names from the CSV header
         - Column types from the data (text, number, date, boolean, select)
         - Select options if a column has few unique values
      4. Review the detected schema, adjust types if needed
      5. Click Import

      ### Type Detection
      The auto-detect examines the first 100 rows:
      - Numbers: columns where all values parse as numbers
      - Dates: columns matching common date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, etc.)
      - Booleans: columns with only true/false/yes/no/1/0 values
      - Select: text columns with 10 or fewer unique values
      - Text: everything else

      ### Limits
      Tables are limited to 100 rows. If your CSV has more rows, only the first 100 are imported.

      ## Exporting Data

      1. Open the table you want to export
      2. Click "Export" in the toolbar
      3. A CSV file downloads with:
         - Column names as headers
         - All rows in the table
         - Values formatted appropriately (dates as YYYY-MM-DD, booleans as true/false)

      ### Notes
      - Export includes all rows, regardless of active filters
      - Column names are used as headers (not internal IDs)
      - The file is named after the table (e.g., "Bug Tracker.csv")
